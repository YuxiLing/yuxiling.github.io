title: "Langkawi Retreat 07-2025"
excerpt: "A peaceful island of blue seas and quiet skies. We held Verse Seminars at the hotel -- even with a sea-view meeting room and tea-break snacks! In the afternoons, we set out to explored the island. I like the moment of having a coconut ice cream at the top of Langkawi's highest mountain, looking out over the island's breathtaking landscape. This picture was taken during our mangrove safari tour."
