title: "PLDI Copenhagen Trip 06-2024"
excerpt: "We arrived one day before the main conference. I rented a car for a one-day road trip. The original travel proposal included four famous castles and ancient villiges around Zealand island. But my advisor rejected it and chose to visit only one castle and a wild deer park. It turned out to be a wonderful and relexing trip. This picture was taken with our fancy car just before we set off."
