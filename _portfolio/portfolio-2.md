title: "Food Hunting 04-2025"
excerpt: "I remember this was the third time we went to Lau Pa Sat for dinner within a month. Chili crab is my favorite food, though we do not oder it that often. But luckly, we had it this time. Gilled prawns are another favorite of mine, but I can only get peeled prawns when I am going with my advisor and some lab mates."
