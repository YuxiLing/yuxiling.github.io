title: "Penang Retreat 08-2024"
excerpt: "This was our first retreat trip. Maylasia was one of the few destinations where none of us needed a visa to enter, though it does cost me a passport page each time! We had many brainstorming sessions on LLM-based PL research, along with adventures exploring Penang Hill and George Town. We purchased an expensive group picture at the top of Penang Hill. It now sits proudly on my desk. This picture was taken while we were having an unforgettable Malaysian Laksa."
