title: "ICFP/SPLASH 10-2025"
excerpt: "An inspiring week at Marina Bay Sands. During the conference, someone asked me, "What kind of research would you do if I did't have to worry about graduation, work, or money?". Having been anxious for months about the research before the event, my instinctive reply was, " I wouldn't do research". Yet the question lingered throughout the week. Reflecting on my PhD journey and how I reached me current path, I realized that what I have now and what I am doing is already what I truly enjoy. This picture was taken on the first day of the conference with my advisor and labmates."
