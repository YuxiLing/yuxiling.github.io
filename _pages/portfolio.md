How to stay happy during a PhD? 

Well, it is a long-term project -- just as important as research itself. I do not have the "right" answer, but I would like to share some precious moments from my time in the VERSE lab. These moments have kept me going through hard times,
reminding me that joinning this group was absolutely one of the best choice I have ever made in my PhD.

I like this team as much as I like PL resrach : )
